                <p>hello! welcome to my space :] i’m a third year design student at san francisco state university, but i’m originally from antioch, california. some of my favorite things are my girlfriend, my dog, and matcha lattes. some of my hobbies include listening to music, going to concerts, watching movies, thrifting, and eating yummy food. some of my pet peeves are people who get mad easily and not being able to find parking at school.</p>
                <br>
                <p>i have several goals for this semester. one of them is to pass all of my classes with good grades! i hope to learn a lot, build a portfolio, and hopefully find an internship or work study within the design field if i can. another one of my goals is to have as much fun as possible. a lot of my friends will be graduating soon, and i’d like to spend a lot of time with them while they’re still here. lastly, i’d like to rediscover my passion for design and remember why i chose this major in the first place. it’s been rough lately, but i think that if i can feel fulfilled by the work that i’m doing, it will all be worth it in the end.</p>
                <br>
                <p>i’m having a bit of a tough time with this class if i’m being completely honest, but i’m really trying my best so that’s always enough for me. i’m hoping to continue to be interested in front end design and continue my studies here at sfsu but i am also keeping my options open for other opportunities that may arise. </p>
                <br>
                <p>i had fun designing my website and i hope you enjoy getting to know me! html and css are hard work and i really had to push myself to complete this project. hopefully it will get easier as the semester goes on lol!!!</p>
