        <p>and this is my portfolio! i’m a third year design student at sfsu but i’m originally from antioch, ca. some of my favorite things are my girlfriend, my dog, and matcha lattes. some of my hobbies include listening to music, playing volleyball, watching movies, thrifting, and eating yummy food.</p>
        <p>i have several goals for this semester. one of them is to pass all of my classes with good grades! i hope to learn a lot, build a portfolio, and hopefully find an internship or work study within the design field this semester. another one of my goals is to have as much fun as possible. a lot of my friends will be graduating soon, and i’d like to spend a lot of time with them while i can. lastly, i’d like to rediscover my passion for design and remember why i chose this major in the first place. it’s been rough lately, but i think that if i can feel fulfilled by the work that i’m doing, it will all be worth it in the end.</p>
        <p>i’m having fun so far learning html in this class. i’m hoping to continue to be interested in front end design and continue my studies here at sfsu!</p>
